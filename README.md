# M&A Financial Model (Acquisition Analysis)

## Overview
This project is a merger & acquisition (M&A) financial model built in Excel to evaluate the acquisition of a target company by an acquirer (“Project Alpha”).  
The model analyzes transaction structure, purchase consideration, synergies, pro forma financials, and deal impact on shareholder value.

The objective is to assess whether the transaction is accretive or dilutive to the acquirer and to estimate post-merger financial performance.
